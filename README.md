Contacts App

Specification
Your system should provide the following functionality:
 - Names, Addresses (as strings), phone numbers and birthdays should be able to be stored in the contacts application.
 - Note birthdays can be stored either as String or Date.
 - A full list of all people and their details should be able to be retrieved from the contacts application.
 - You should be able to search the contacts application (for completely matching) names, addresses, phone numbers or birthdays. This should return a list of all matches and their details.
 - There are many approaches you could take, with different levels of assumptions. One might consider case sensitive or case insensitive search or may disregard whitespace differences in telephone numbers. You are free to make this decision, so long as you state your assumptions briefly in your README.md.
 - Store data in a file for subsequent re-use i.e., load/save data to/from file on entry/exit.
 - It should be possible to change any/all details for an entry in the contacts application.
